# Hi :)

I'm Dominika and I'm 3rd year IT student at Politechnika Bia≈Çostocka. 
I'm currently trying all of the areas of IT that my university has to offer, focusing on Python and Django and dreaming about data science ;)
In my repo you'll find projects, mostly web applications, I did by myself or in collaboration with other students.
I'm more into backend but not scared of front either.

PS. In my free time I'm scout leader and work part time as sailing instructor, so definitely team-building activities are my thing :D I love dogs and I'm always up to good coffee ;)
